<p>This tool allows users to forecast the demand for hospital beds and ICU beds up through the next three weeks in Delhi NCR. Users provide the <strong>number of days to forecast</strong> forward (maximum of 21), as well as the suspected <strong>death&nbsp;reporting fraction</strong> (the proportion&mdash;out of 1.0&mdash;of total, true deaths that are included in the reported death counts). The underlying model assumes that R0, COVID-19's <em>basic reproductive number</em>, was reduced to 0.5 of its unabated value during Lockdown 1.0; to 0.7 of its unabated value during Lockdown 3.0; and to 0.8 of its unabated value at the start of Unlock 1.0. (Because Delhi's lockdown was not materially altered during Lockdown 2.0, we do not currently assume any changes for that phase.)</p>
<p>Users can choose to simulate future changes in Delhi's lockdown/unlock status by indicating the number of days until a future change, along with the suspected modification to R0. For example, if an additional lockdown is suspected to <strong>reduce R0 to 20%</strong> of its unabated value <strong>one week</strong> from the present day, users can indicate that R0 will change to<strong> 0.2 </strong>in<strong> 7 days</strong>. If Delhi is suspected to <strong>re-open (unlock) entirely</strong> in<strong> 10 days</strong>, users can indicate that R0 will change to<strong> 1.0 </strong>in <strong>10 days</strong>. The corresponding visuals will account for this simulated change.</p>
